In the field of seismology
because it takes time and labor to pick up the first arrival of seismic wave by hand
automatic pickup method is generally adopted at present.
This method uses CNN network to extract waveform features
and uses a large number of sample data to train
so as to quickly pick up the first arrival of seismic waveform.
This method is proposed by Xu Zhen
a graduate student of Nanjing University.
